BookMyShow is an online platform for booking movie tickets, 
events, concerts, and other entertainment-related activities. 
When designing a database for a service like BookMyShow, it's 
essential to consider the various entities and relationships 
involved. Here's a simplified database design for BookMyShow:

Entities:

User
Movie
Event
Theater
Show
Seat
Booking
Relationships:

User - Booking (One-to-Many): A user can have multiple 
bookings, but each booking belongs to only one user.
Movie - Show (One-to-Many): A movie can have multiple shows, 
but each show is for a specific movie.
Event - Show (One-to-Many): An event can have multiple shows, 
but each show is for a specific event.
Theater - Show (One-to-Many): A theater can host multiple 
shows, but each show takes place in a specific theater.
Show - Seat (One-to-Many): A show can have multiple seats, 
but each seat is for a specific show.
Show - Booking (One-to-Many): A show can have multiple 
bookings, but each booking is for a specific show.
Seat - Booking (One-to-One): A seat can be booked only once 
for a show, and a booking corresponds to a single seat.
Below are the attributes for each entity:

user_id (Primary Key)

movie_id (Primary Key)

release_date

This is a simplified design that can be further normalized 
and optimized based on the specific requirements and 
performance needs of the BookMyShow application. Additional 
features like user reviews, promotions, and loyalty programs 
can be incorporated by adding more entities and relationships 
as needed.
